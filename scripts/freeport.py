"""Pick a free TCP port, preferring a given one.

Streamlit aborts if its port is taken, which happens whenever another local
dashboard is already running on 8501. The launch scripts call this first and
pass the result through as --server.port.

    python scripts/freeport.py        # prints 8501, or the next free port
    python scripts/freeport.py 8600   # start looking at 8600 instead

The chosen port goes to stdout (so a script can capture it); anything human-
facing goes to stderr. Stdlib only, so this runs before any deps are installed.
